#### Abstract:
We address the problem of multimodal spatial understanding by decoding a set of language-expressed spatial relations 
to a set of 2D spatial arrangements in a multi-object and multi-relationship setting. 
We frame the task as arranging a scene of clip-arts given a textual description. 
We propose a simple and effective model architecture Spatial-Reasoning Bert (SR-Bert), 
trained to decode text to 2D spatial arrangements in a non-autoregressive manner. 
SR-Bert can decode both explicit and implicit language to 2D spatial arrangements, generalizes to out-of-sample data 
to a reasonable extent and can generate complete abstract scenes if paired with a clip-arts predictor. 
Finally, we qualitatively evaluate our method with a user study, validating that our generated spatial arrangements 
align with human expectation.
