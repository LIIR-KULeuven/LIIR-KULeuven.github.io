## Zero-Shot Recommendations as Language Modeling

### Damien Sileo
#### Abstract:
Abstract:
Recommendation is the task of ranking items (e.g. movies or products) according to individual user needs. Current systems rely on collaborative filtering and content-based techniques, which both require structured training data. We propose a framework for recommendation with off-the-shelf pretrained language models (LM) that only used unstructured text corpora as training data. If a user u liked "Matrix" and "Inception", we construct a textual prompt, e.g. "Movies like Matrix, Inception, <m>" to estimate the affinity between u and m with LM likelihood. We motivate our idea with a corpus analysis, evaluate several prompt structures, and we compare LM-based recommendation with standard matrix factorization trained on different data regimes.
