## General Idea

With the Journal Club we aim to do a couple of things:
 - Stay up to date with current research
 - Be able to share our recent work with colleagues
 - Most importantly: Allow for healthy discussions

To this end, we have two types of club meetings, the **presenting** meetings and the **reading** meetings. 
We will always make sure that there are some snacks and/or beverages present: sandwiches during lunch, coffee and cookies otherwise. 

## Journal Club - Presenting

During the presenting meetings, we have the opportunity to give a presentation to other members of the group. 
This allows us to practice for upcoming conferences, or get feedback regarding some ideas we have. We propose three types of presentations:
 - Conference: To practice for some upcoming conference. May take every form (slides, poster, jupyter notebook, etc.)
 - Pitch: To pitch an idea to get feedback and a discussion on this idea.
 - Demo: To share some amazing implementation that you think can benefit the others. 

We always try to keep this very informal and discussions are encouraged. We limit a single presentation to be 20 minutes at most, with 10 minutes for discussion and questions. There is a maximum of 2 presentations per meeting. 
There will be a host during these meetings to open the meeting, introduce potential guest speakers, and watch the time. 
Tip: by asking questions during the presentations, it is easier to get immediate feedback. The host checks with you if this is okay. You can prepare in advance by creating some breakpoints in the presentation for questions.

The plan is to have these meetings **monthly**, but only when someone comes forward to be put on the schedule. **NOTE: For your 'doctoral diary' you need to give two seminars about personal work. Journal club presentations count as well.**

The scheduling for this is done by Nathan Cornille. Send a mail to _firstname_ (dot) _lastname_ (at) kuleuven (dot) be, or message on Slack.

## Journal Club - Reading

In the reading meetings, we come together to discuss a paper. There are no restrictions on these papers, as long as they are not very trivial and simple to understand. We regularly schedule this meeting **every two weeks** where we discuss one paper a time.  

Papers are chosen by the means of a poll. Everyone can propose and vote for a paper for the next meeting when the poll opens. The presenter and the in-depth-reader choose a paper **one week in advance**, hopefully considering the votes. **These polls are hosted on the LIIR slack channel.** 

Everybody that comes to these meetings is expected to have read the paper. However, to guide the discussion, we have some roles that go deeper into it.
 - **In-Depth-Reader(s)**: Reads the paper in advance in much detail. Ideas for how to prepare:
   - Read per paragraph/part/section.
   - For each part, determine what the main points are. 
   - For each part, how clear was this part? Well written, weird idea, difficult math, etc?
   - For each part, is there some discussion point: How do we interpret this? Does it make sense? Can we ever use this? Would it survive different settings? etc.
   - For each part, is external information required to understand this? (If you have time to spare, feel free to search for it.)
 - **Presenter**: Same as the *in-depth-reader(s)*. Additional tasks:
   - Starts the meeting with a very short summary.
   - Guides the discussion during the meeting.
   - The main person who is responsible for bringing forward discussion points. 
   - Engages others to participate in the discussion. 
   - Optional: displays paper on-screen with markings, prepares some slides to guide the reading and discussion (no lecture or long presentation).
   
All the roles are filled randomly, making sure everybody will be presenter, and you collaborate with different in-depth-readers.

There will be a host present to make sure there is a good flow in the discussion. Most importantly, the host makes sure there are snacks present.

If you are planning to join regularly and want to be added to the pool of in-depth-readers/presenters, please contact Katrien Laenen. Send a mail to _firstname_ (dot) _lastname_ (at) kuleuven (dot) be, or message on Slack.

| 8 OCT 12:00-13:00 | Presenting | Presenters: Liesbeth & Quentin         | **Checkworthiness in Automatic Claim Detection Models: Definitions and Analysis of Datasets** <br /> (Liesbeth) <br /><br /> Public, professional and academic interest in automated fact-checking has drastically increased over the past decade, with many aiming to automate one of the first steps in a fact-check procedure: the selection of so-called checkworthy claims. However, there is little agreement on the definition and characteristics of checkworthiness among fact-checkers, which is consequently reflected in the datasets used for training and testing checkworthy claim detection models. After elaborate analysis of checkworthy claim selection procedures in fact-check organisations and analysis of state-of-the-art claim detection datasets, checkworthiness is defined as the concept of having a spatiotemporal and context-dependent worth and need to have the correctness of the objectivity it conveys verified. This is irrespective of the claimâ€™s perceived veracity judgement by an individual based on prior knowledge and beliefs. Concerning the characteristics of current datasets, it is argued that the data is not only highly imbalanced and noisy, but also too limited in scope and language. Furthermore, we believe that the subjective concept of checkworthiness might not be a suitable filter for claim detection. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08854.pdf) <br /><br /> **Speech to Semantics: A representation learning approach** <br /> (Quentin) <br /><br /> In this work, we are trying to leverage the performance of pretrained NLP models such as BERT to learn to generate speech features that hold semantic information. We are using a transformer encoder-decoder network in a student / teacher framework to predict the representations produced by DistilBERT. The model is trained on the Corpus Gesproken Nederlands. We evaluate the trained features on a speech-to-intent task with two unobserved datasets. |
