## General Idea

With the Journal Club we aim to do a couple of things:
 - Stay up to date with current research
 - Be able to share our recent work with colleagues
 - Most importantly: Allow for healthy discussions

To this end, we have two types of club meetings, the **seminar** meetings and the **reading** meetings. 
We will always make sure that there are some snacks and/or beverages present: sandwiches during lunch, coffee and cookies otherwise. 
Here you can read a short introduction about the setup of the [seminar]({{ "/journal-club/intro-seminar/" | relative_url }})
and the [reading]({{ "/journal-club/intro-reading/" | relative_url }}) meetings.
