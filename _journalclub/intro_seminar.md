## Journal Club - Seminars

During the seminar meetings, we have the opportunity to give a presentation to other members of the group. 
This allows us to practice for upcoming conferences, or get feedback regarding some ideas we have. We propose three types of presentations:
 - Conference: To practice for some upcoming conference. May take every form (slides, poster, jupyter notebook, etc.)
 - Pitch: To pitch an idea to get feedback and a discussion on this idea.
 - Demo: To share some amazing implementation that you think can benefit the others. 
 
When we have gaps in our schedule, we try to fill these by inviting guest speakers to present some of there work. If you have friends or collegues that could give an interresting presentation, please let us know.

We always try to keep this very informal and discussions are encouraged. We limit a single presentation to be 20 minutes at most, with 10 minutes for discussion and questions. There is a maximum of 2 presentations per meeting. 
There will be a host during these meetings to open the meeting, introduce potential guest speakers, and watch the time. 
Tip: by asking questions during the presentations, it is easier to get immediate feedback. The host checks with you if this is okay. You can prepare in advance by creating some breakpoints in the presentation for questions.

The plan is to have these meetings **monthly**, but only when someone comes forward to be put on the schedule. **NOTE: For your 'doctoral diary' you need to give two seminars about personal work. Journal club presentations count as well.**

The scheduling for this is done by Nathan Cornille. Send a mail to _firstname_ (dot) _lastname_ (at) kuleuven (dot) be, or message on Slack.
